== Camel K on Openshift

Author: Phil Prosser (feedback to pprosser@redhat.com)

=== Introduction

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift).

The purpose of this lab is to show you how easy it is to build, deploy, and delete Camel K integations using very simple examples. It is not the goal of this lab to demonstrate the integration capabilities of Camel K.

We are going to use a new project to create our Camel K integrations

TIP: This workshop requires you to be logged on to both the OpenShift console and the terminal as described in the pre-requisites. If you do not have both tabs logged in please follow the instructions before continuing

=== Check the project is ready to use

In the browser based terminal window, check you are still logged on and using the correct project by typing:

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc project
----

TIP: If the response from the commands indicates that you are not userX (where X is your assigned user number) and not using the project sandboxX please repeat the commands in the pre-requisites.

=== Camel K and the Operator Lifecycle Manager

.Camel K and the Operator Lifecycle Manager
****
Camel K uses the Operator Lifecycle manager, this means that new Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) will be added to Openshift. These CRDs will extend the Openshift data model and allow Camel K to be managed using the standard ‘oc’ command. Installing operators requires a higher cluster privilage. All the required operators for the workshop should have been pre-installed for you
****

The examples required for this workshop have been pre-created as part of the terminal. In the terminal type:

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples
ls
----

These are the example files we will be using.

TIP: To allow a developer to easily interact with an Openshift cluster, Camel K has it's own command line interface. The cli is called 'kamel' and is preinstalled in the terminal app

Before we can create an integration, we need to add a Camel K 'IntegrationPlatform'.

In the terminal window, type

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/camelfiles/camelkplatform/
oc apply -f integrationplatform.yaml
----

now type

[source]
----
oc get integrationplatform
----

The output should look similar to below

[source]
----
NAME      PHASE
camel-k   Ready
----

Once the "Phase" says "Ready", you can continue

You should now have all the pieces you need to start creating and deploying lightweight Camel Integrations to Openshift.

Now enter the following commands:

[source]
----
oc project
oc whoami
oc version
cd /workspace/examples
ls
----

You should see an output similar to the one shown below:

=== Deploy a Camel K Interation

Firstly, let’s start by deploying a simple integration, type

[source]
----
kamel run simple.groovy
----

NOTE: The first time you deploy an Integration, it will take a few minutes. The operator manages all dependencies required by the Integration and downloads these from the Red Hat repository on demand. Once downloaded, the operator caches dependancies therefore subsequent deployments are significantly quicker. If you want to see what's happen, in the terminal window type 'oc get pods', you will see that there are builds running

To see what is going on go to the console UI in the Browser, make sure you are switched to 'Developer view'

Click on 'Advanced/Project Details'

If your screen is wide enough the Activity pane will appear on the right hand side. If not, scroll down to the 'Activity' pane - this shows the events and actions currently occuring within the project. It will look similar to this:

image::camelk-2a.png[Deploying Camel K activity]

Switch back to the project Topology view by clicking on 'Topology'

Once the deployment is complete, you will see 'Simple' deployed on the topology view

Click on 'Simple' (this is your integration), and you can see what’s going on.

Once the pod has a dark blue ring around it, it is running, as per the screenshot below. The devex4 application is your terminal application and can be ignored for the duration of this chapter

image::camelk-3.png[Running Integration]

If you haven't already, click 'inside the circle' to open the overview window

Click on 'Resources'

There will be one Pod running with a name similar to simple-xxxxxxx-yyyyy (randomly generated). Next to it will be an indicator that it is running. Next to that is a clickable point labelled 'View Logs'. Click on this.

The output of the log should look as shown below:

image::camelk-4.png[Integration logs]

The integration is a simple timer that triggers every 1 second and writes to the log file.

In the Terminal Browser window type

[source]
----
oc get integrations
----
 
You should now see an integration called 'simple' in the list similar to this:

[source]
----
NAME     PHASE     KIT                        REPLICAS
simple   Running   kit-bpj4ns3tvn0va7c7gs9g   1
----

In the Terminal browser window type

[source]
----
oc describe integration simple
----

If you scan to the top of the output you will see some code in the 'from' component that represents the integration's behaviour

We will now make a change to the integration

In the browser terminal window
[source]
----
vi simple.groovy 
----

You will see the text - 'Hello Camel K from ${routeId}' in the code definition of the integration

Change the text to the following by pressing [ESC] then I to insert:

[source]
----
'Hello Camel K from ${routeId}. Added some more text'
----

To save the change now hit [ESC]:wq[RETURN]

Now, you need to deploy this integration to Openshift again to test by typing:

[source]
----
kamel run simple.groovy
----

If you are quick enough (you need to be really quick) switch back to the OpenShift console and hit 'Topology', you’ll see the integration doing a re-deployment

Look at the log file again (as above) to make sure the change has been deployed

image::camelk-4a.png[New output]

=== Deploy Camel K in Developer mode

While the process of redeploying is simple, it isn’t very developer friendly. The 'kamel' cli has a developer friendly “hot deploy” mode that makes this experience much better

First Delete the integration. 

There are 2 ways you can do this in the Terminal Browser window (your choice). Either use the “kamel” cli:

[source]
----
kamel delete simple
----

Or use the Openshift cli:

[source]
----
oc delete integration simple
----

NOTE: This is the great thing about CRDs, you can use the normal Openshift cli to managed the custom data model (integrations in this case)

To deploy the integration in developer mode, type:

[source]
----
kamel run simple.groovy --dev
----

You will see the deployment phases logged on the screen, followed by the log outputting automatically from the integration pod, useful for a developer to see what’s going on. The output should look similar to the screenshot below

image::camelk-5.png[Developer Mode]

NOTE: For the next exercise, you will need 2 terminal windows. Go to the OpenShift Console, which should be on the Developer view. Click on Topology if the Topology window is not currently in focus. Click on the URL icon at the top right of the 'Devex4' application as you did to originally open the terminal. This will open another Terminal for you to use.

TIP: In the first terminal tab, which will be the one furthest to the right, you will notice that the terminal window is outputting the log of the active and running integration

In the *new* terminal now type:

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples
----

Make another change to the text in “simple.groovy” by following the same instructions above - make sure the text outputted is different and that you save it as described above

Once you have saved the changes, go back to the browser terminal tab outputting the log

Switch to the original output tab. The integration will shutdown and restart with the new code and new text

You should see that the changes have been automatically applied to the running integration, without the need to redeploy 

Go back to the browser terminal that’s outputting the log, press ‘ctrl c’

Look at the Topology view in the Openshift console(or 'oc get integrations' in the terminal) 

The integration should have been deleted and no Pods should now be running (other than the Terminal pod), just like a developer would see by pressing 'ctrl c' on a Java application running on their laptop

Close down one of the terminal window tabs so you only have one terminal and the OpenShift console

=== Optional labs

Feel free to take a look at some of the other examples

TIP: Instructions on how to run the integrations are in the integration source code
E.g. kamel run --name=rest-with-restlet --dependency=camel-rest --dependency=camel-restlet examples/RestWithRestlet.java

The example above demonstrates Camel K deploying a Java based Camel Route that exposes a Restful service via an Openshift route - the Camel K operator does all the hard work for you

NOTE: some of the examples might take a little longer to deploy as the operator will need to download more dependencies

To test the rest api, you need to know what the OpenShift Route is

In the Developer UI, go back to the Topology view, and click on “rest-with-restlet” application

Click on resources, and you will see the http route at the bottom of the page

Click on the http link

You will get an error as the integration will only respond to /hello. Append ‘/hello’ to the URI
Now you should see a response
