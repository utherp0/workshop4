== Application Basics

=== Introduction

This chapter will introduce the attendee to the mechanics of creating and manipulating Applications using OpenShift Container Platform. It will introduce the two distinct contexts of the User Interface, the Adminstrator and Developer views, and guide the attendee through creating some Applications.

TIP: The attendee will be using a browser for interacting with both the OpenShift Container Platform UI and the provided terminal (for command line exercises). It is suggested the attendee uses Chrome or Firefox.

=== Starting up - logging on and creating a project

Log on to cluster at {webConsoleUrl}[{webConsoleUrl}] as 'userx', where x is the number assigned to you by the course administrator, password 'openshift'

Ensure you are on the Administrator View (top level, select Administrator)

*The Administrator view provides you with an extended functionality interface that allows you to deep dive into the objects available to your user. The Developer view is an opinionated interface designed to ease the use of the system for developers. This workshop will have you swapping between the contexts for different tasks.*

Click on 'Create Project'

Name - ‘sandboxX’ where x is user number

Display Name, Description are labels

When created click on 'Role Bindings'

*By default when you create a Project within OpenShift your user is given administration rights. This allows the user 
to create any objects that they have rights to create and to change the security and access settings for the project 
itself, i.e. add users as Administrators, Edit Access, Read access or disable other user's abilities to even see 
the project and the objects within.*

=== Creating your first Application

In the top left of the UI, where the label indicates the view mode, change the mode from Administrator to Developer

image::applicationbasics-2.png[Developer Context]

Click 'Add'

*The Catalog screen for the developer combines all the ways components can be added into the Project. These are:*

* *From Git - this provides another way to do a Source-2-Image build by first choosing the Git repo and then the builder image to use*
* *Container Image - this provides a way to directly deploy an Image from a repository*
* *From Catalog - this allows the Developer to browse all available templates, which are predefined sets of Objects to create an application* 
* *From Dockerfile - this allows the Developer to do a controlled build of an Image from a Dockerfile*
* *YAML - this allows the Developer to provide a set of populated YAML to define the objects to be added to the Project*
* *Database - this allows the Developer to browse pre-created Database services to add to the Project*

Select ‘From Catalog’

Enter ‘node’ in the search box

image::applicationbasics-1.png[Node Choice]

*OpenShift allows for multiple base images to be built upon - the selection of node searches for any images or templates registered into the system 
with the label 'node'. In the screenshot above, and in the catalog you will be presented with, there will be a selection of base images.*

Select ‘Node.js’

image::applicationbasics-3.png[Node Choice]

*When you select an option, in this case the Node.js builder one, you are presented with a wizard that shows you exactly what 
components will be created as part of your Project. In this case, with Node.js, the template will create a build config, that will build the 
Image that will contain your Application, an ImageStream which is the OpenShift representation of an Image, a deployment config, which defines exactly how the image 
will be deployed as a running Container within the Project, a service which is the internal endpoint for the application within the Project and a route, 
optionally, which will provide access to the Application for external consumers.*

Click on 'Create Application'

*This approach uses the OpenShift ''source-2-image'' concept, which is a controlled mechanism provided by OpenShift that automates the creation 
of application images using a base image and a source repository.* 

Change the Builder Image Version to 8

*The ''source-2-image'' approach allows you to use differing versions of a base image - in this case you can execute the Node build against a number of supported Node 
versions.*

Git repo - https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews[https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews]

In a separate browser tab go to https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews[https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews]

*If you visit the URL you will see there is no OpenShift specific code in the repository at all.*

Close the github tab

Back at the OCP4.2 Ux leave the Application as ‘Create Application’.

*OpenShift 4 introduces the concept of Application Grouping. This allows a visualisation of multiple Applications in the same 'group', making visibility of the Application much 
simpler.*

Ensure the application name is ‘nodenews-app’

Ensure the Name is ‘nodenews’

Ensure the ‘Create Route is checked’

Click 'Create'

*The Topology view is a new feature of OpenShift 4 that provides a dynamic and useful visualisation of all of your Applications in a given Project.*

Click on the Icon marked 'Node'

image::applicationbasics-4.png[Node Sidepanel]

*The side-panel contains an overview of the Application you chose. In this case it will cover 
the build. Once a build has completed this side panel shows the Pods that are running, the builds that have completed, the services 
exported for the Application and the routes, if the Application has any.*

Wait for the Build to finish, the Pod to change from Container Creating to Running

*When an Application is created the Pod ring will be empty, indicating that an Application will appear once the build has completed. When the build 
completes the Pod ring will switch to light blue, indicating the Pod is being pulled (the image is being pulled from the registry to the Node where the 
Pod will land) and is starting (the Pod is physically in place but the Containers within it are not reporting as ready). Once the Pod is placed and running the colour
of the Pod ring will change to dark blue.*

Click on the Tick at the bottom left of the Pod

*If you scroll the log of the Build output you will see the steps that the build takes. This includes laying the foundational file layers for the base 
image, performing the code specific build operations (in this case an ''npm install'') and then pushing the file layers for the image into the OpenShift 
integrated registry.*

=== Adding additional Applications

Click on 'Topology'

Click 'Add'

Click 'From Catalog'

Search for ‘httpd’

Select the (httpd) template

Click on 'Create Application'

Leave Image Version as 2.4

Set the git repo to ‘https://github.com/utherp0/forumstaticassets’

Ensure the Application is ‘nodenews-app’

Ensure the name is forumstaticassets

Ensure the ‘Create a Route’ checkbox is clicked

Click 'Create'

*Note that the new Application icon appears within a bounded area on the Topology page labelled with the 'Application' chosen above. If you click on the area between the Pods you can move 
the group as a single action.*

Click on the forumstaticassets Pod

Watch the build complete, the Container Creating and the Running event

Click 'Add'

Click 'From Catalog'

Search for ‘node’

Select ‘Node.js’

Click 'Create Application'

Leave at Builder Image Version 10

Set the git repo to ‘https://github.com/utherp0/ocpnode’

In the ‘Application’ pulldown select ‘Create Application

In the ‘Application Name’ enter ‘ocpnode-app’

Ensure the Name is ‘ocpnode’

Ensure the ‘Create Route’ is checked

Click 'Create'

Click on the ‘ocpnode’ Application in the topology - click on the ‘cross’ icon to centralise the topology

*Now we have created a new Application grouping you will see two ''cloud'' groupings, labelled with the appropriate Application name you entered.*

=== Interacting with OpenShift through the Command Line

With the OpenShift Enterprise command line interface (CLI), you can create applications and manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. 
The CLI is ideal in situations where you are:

* Working directly with project source code.
* Scripting OpenShift Enterprise operations.
* Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the web console.

The CLI is available using the oc command:

[source,shell]
----
oc {command}
----

You have two options to get a working CLI. Either install `oc` on your localhost or use a docker image in OpenShift. The image option is pre-built and running already and is easier if you have a locked-down laptop and are unable to download and install additional applications.

==== Option 1: Installing the CLI on localhost

The easiest way to download the CLI is by accessing the Command Line Tools page on the web console from the question mark on teh top right corner [ (?)-> Command Line Tools ]

image::applicationbasics-5.png[Command Line Tools]

From this page you can download the oc and odo command line tools.

If you wish to install the command line tools locally then you may also need to download and command line tools for OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) and Kamel. Instructions on this is at the start of each chapter.

==== Option 2: Use a pre-configured docker image on OpenShift

This option installs and runs a docker image inside OpenShift that already has oc (and other command line tools) installed and configured. To install this image, do the following:

Login to the OCP system through the UI. (userX / openshift)
Ensure that you are in the Developer mode of the user interface by selecting Developer in the top left corner menu. Select the project drop down menu and select Create Project.
Create a new project:
Name: oconline-userX
Display Name: OC Terminal

You will then see a Topology view that allows you to create new workloads from a variety of sources as shown below:

image::applicationbasics-6.png[Topology view]

Select container image and paste into the image name :

[source,shell]
----
quay.io/marrober/devex-terminal-4
----

Press the search button on the end of the line to force the application to examine the repository image.

For the Application name enter : DevEx-Terminal
For the Name : enter DevEx-Terminal
Ensure the box is ticked for 'Create a route to the application'

Click create.

Wait for the pod to spin up and show a dark blue ring on the topology view.

Click on the pod and on then on the resources tab on the right hand side click on the route. This will launch the terminal in a new browser window. 

Keep this terminal window open for the remainder of the workshop for all of your command line interaction.

[[setup-login]]
=== Using your terminal (Both options)

If this document refer to _your terminal_ it will either be on your localhost or the containerised terminal depending your option above.

(Login options for the installed OC command line tool only).
* In the Web Console, select the top right pulldown, choose btn:[Copy Login Command]
* This will require you to login again using your credentials (to prove who you are) and will then display a web page with 'Display Token' on it. Select this link and copy the full likne that behind with oc login --token......
* Paste this into the command line window on your local machine where you have access to run the oc command. Note that oc must be added to your path.

The response to executing the login command should look similar to that shown below :

[source,shell]
----
Logged into "https://api.cluster-london-a6e1.london-a6e1.example.opentlc.com:6443" as "user1" using the token provided.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----

Make sure `oc` is working, type:

[source,shell]
----
oc whoami
oc version
----

image::screenshot_whoami_version.png[Basic oc commands]

NOTE: Also see the *Command-Line Reference*: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html]

To explore the command line further execute the following commands and observe the results.

[source,shell]
----
oc projects
----

User should have access to one project, explain the ability to access multiple projects

[source,shell]
----
oc project sandboxX
----

User should now be using the sandboxX project created and configured earlier

[source,shell]
----
oc get users
----

*There is a level of permission within the OpenShift system called ''Cluster Admin''. This permission allows a User to access any of the objects on the 
system regardless of Project. It is effectively a super-user and as such normal users do not normally have this level of access.*

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods
----

*If you look carefully at the Pods shown you will notice there are additional Pods above and beyond the ones expected for your Applications. If you look at the state of 
these Pods they will be marked as Completed. Everything in OpenShift is executed as a Pod, including Builds. These completed Pods are the Builds we have run so far.*

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods | grep Completed
----

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods | grep Running
----

[source,shell]
----
oc get dc
----

*DC is an abbreviation for Deployment Config. These are Objects that directly define how an Application is deployed within OpenShift. This is the ''ops''
side of the OpenShift system. Deployment Configs are different to Kubernetes Deployments in that they are an extension and contain things such as Config Maps, Secrets, 
Volume Mounts, labelled targetting of Nodes and the like.* 

[source,shell]
----
oc scale dc/nodenews --replicas=2
----

=== A Summary of Application Interactions

Go back to the UI and make sure you are on Developer mode. Click on Topology. 

Click on the ‘nodenews’ application

Note the ‘DC’ reference to the application under the icon

In the pop-up panel on the right click on 'Resources'

Note that there are two pods running with the application now

Change the mode from Developer to Administrator

Select the 'sandboxx' project in the project list

Note the metrics for the project

Click on 'Workloads' and then select Pods.

Change to Developer mode and then select Topology if the Topology page isn’t already shown

Click and hold on the forumstaticassets Pod and drag it onto the ocpnode-app

Select ‘move’ when it prompts whether you want to move it

*This concept of Application grouping allows for much better visualisation of the complete application.*

Continue on with the Deployments chapter, which uses the applications created here to show the capabilities of the deployment configuration and how to alter the behaviour and file system of a Container without changing the image.
