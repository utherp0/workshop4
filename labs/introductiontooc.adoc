=== Introduction

This lab introduces the command line interface to OpenShift, 'oc', and the concepts of the interactions you can have with the OpenShift system through it.

TIP: The attendee will be using the terminal application created in the pre-requisites step (for command line exercises). It is strongly suggested the attendee uses Chrome or Firefox. All of this lab is done with the terminal.

=== A quick overview of 'oc'

OpenShift is built around Kubernetes, which is a fantastically complex and elegant orchestration system for containers. It works by maintaining a state vision of the entire system, which is a set of what are called 'objects'.

An 'object' has a type - i.e. Service, Pod, User, Namespace and the like. This type tells Kubernetes how and what it can do with the object; in fact Kubernetes has a number of processes called 'controllers' whose only job is to create, monitor and maintain these 'objects'. 

In order for a user to interact with the system, be it OpenShift or Kubernetes, an API is provided that allows you to create, manipulate and remove these objects. But it's very complicated, because of the nature of the systems. 

So, for Kubernetes, there is a command line utility created called 'kubectl'. OpenShift's own command line, 'oc', derives from this utility but adds the extra features, and access to the additional objects that OpenShift offers above and beyond Kubernetes.

What we will be doing in this lab is using the oc client to work with OpenShift from a developers perspective. OpenShift provides a number of ways that you can interact with it; for example the Developer UI, the Administration UI, odo. But oc is the most powerful because it exposes the entire set of objects through the RESTful API provided.

You will find that, once you understand the nature of the underlying objects and the way you can interact with them, that 'oc' is a fantastic tool for developers wanting to use OpenShift to orchestrate their applications.

=== Creating a Project/Namespace

Let's start by going to the terminal window as defined in the pre-requisites. To make sure we are working in the correct context type the following:

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc version
----

image::ocintro1.png[Correct response from oc]

The oc client works using something called a 'context'. This is a valid login to a target OpenShift system. If the commands do not return the successful output (see above for a similar output) then please repeat the login steps listed in the pre-requisites.

What we are going to do is create a Project to work in. This is equivalent, but not the same as, the Kubernetes 'namespace'. Type the following:

[source]
----
oc new-project octest-{{USER_ID}}
----

image::ocintro2.png[Correct response from oc new-project]

What we have done is create a context within our user's object space on the OpenShift Cluster. As creators we have admin access and rights to this space - we can create and delete objects, that we have the rights to create, as much as we like here.

Now type:

[source]
----
oc projects
oc get projects
----

image::ocintro3.png[Correct response from projects commands]

The 'oc projects' is an opinionated command - because we work with Projects so much there is a shortcut for them. The second command is the standard way of getting any object that you have the rights to via the oc command.

Now type:

[source]
----
oc api-resources
----

This command goes to the OpenShift Cluster and gets a list of the all the object types/resources you can see. There are a lot of them. Try this command:

[source]
----
oc explain pods
----

This command will show an explanation of that API object type, namely 'Pods'. Now the cool bit - type the following:

[source]
----
oc explain pods --recursive | more
----

We add the pipe into 'more' as there will be a lot of output.

image::ocintro4.png[Full definition of Pod]

Every object can be described using JSON or YAML - this command returns, from the Server, the exact definition of that object. This is incredibly useful when we get to editing the objects via oc.

There is a lot of information so you can press space repeatedly to view it, or hit Ctrl-C to come out of the output

=== Adding some Applications

OpenShift works with the concept of 'Applications'. An Application translates, in OpenShift speak, to all the object components needed to build and deploy an Application in a Container, and orchestrate that Application appropriately (multiple copies of the Container, configuration settings and the like).

If we started at absolute basics and created all the objects we need for an Application in OpenShift we would have a number of things to remember to created. This would include:

. A BuildConfig, which describes how to build the Image that will contain our Application
. A Build, which is the actual task that executes the BuildConfig, in a Pod, to generate our Application Image
. A Service, which is the IP endpoint for the Application within the OpenShift Cluster
. An ImageStream, which is a wrapper around the created Image. 
. A DeploymentConfig, which tells OpenShift how to physically orchestrate the Application
. A Route, which provides the external connectivity into the Application

Fortunately we can shortcut this as developers, if we have, for example, a GitHub repo with existing code. Type the following:

[source]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/utherp0/meow2 --as-deployment-config
----

The oc command will cause OpenShift to create all the contents it needs for an Application based on the source code it finds at the GitHub repo. In this case the source code contains the building blocks for a node.js application. The image belows shows the output you should receive:

image:ocintro5.png[Result of new-app]

*Note the Resources Created part of the output - from a single command to create an App it has created the core required components.*

Now type the follow, as suggested by the output:

[source]
----
oc status
----

image::ocintro6.png[oc status output]

The system is performing a build, defined by the buildconfig that has been created using the chosen technology deduced by OpenShift from the repo. When the build finishes it will deploy the application - the deployment is shown as the 'dc', which is the deployment config object. This is waiting on the image to be created by the build. It also creates a Service, which is the internal endpoint for the application.

If you wait a little (feel free to repeat the 'oc status' command) the build will complete and the application will be deployed. You can check for when it deploys by typing:

[source]
----
oc get pods
----

Once deployed the output should look like this:

image::ocintro7.png[working pods]

You will notice there are three Pods - two have completed and one is running. This is because those actions of building an Application into an Image and then deploying the Application are executed as Pods themselves.

Now, for the sake of the lab, we will create a second application. Type:

[source]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews --as-deployment-config
----

Again use the 'oc get pods' and 'oc status' to watch the build of the second application. When it completes it will look like this:

image::ocintro8.png[working pods for app2]

=== Using oc to manipulate existing objects

Now we will show the power of the oc command. First, type the following:

[source]
----
oc get pods | grep Running
----

This will list the Pods running, i.e. the applications. We will now scale the 'meow2' application to three Pods and the 'nodenews' application to two Pods. Type the following:

[source]
----
oc scale dc/meow2 --replicas=3
oc scale dc/nodenews --replicas=2
----

Once the commands come back successfully type:

[source]
----
oc get pods | grep Running
----

image::ocintro9.png[all the pods for the two apps]

We are now going to look at the composition of a single 'object', in this case a pod. Using the output of the command above, pick one of the three Running meow2 Pods. You will need the name, which will be meow2-1-xxxxx, where xxxxx are random characters. Using the five characters from your chosen Pod type the following:

[source]
----
oc get pod meow2-1-[PUT YOUR CHOSEN POD'S CHARACTERS HERE]
----

That will give you a simple overview of the object, in this case the Pod. Now type this:

[source]
----
oc get pod meow2-1-[PUT YOUR CHOSEN POD'S CHARACTERS HERE] -o json
----

You will get a huge amount of information. What this command has done is returned the entire object in JSON. Now type this:

[source]
----
oc get pod meow2-1-[PUT YOUR CHOSEN POD'S CHARACTERS HERE] -o yaml
----

Now you will see the entire object listed in YAML. This is the complete object from OpenShift/Kubernetes, so as well as seeing the definition, which is all the components under 'spec:', you will also see the metadata for the object, listed under 'metadata:' and the current status of the object, listed under 'status:'.

=== Using jsonpath to extract specific object values

One of the supported output formats from certain oc commands is 'jsonpath'. This uses the functionally rich XPath syntax to reformat the output. A good introduction to this is available at https://restfulapi.net/json-jsonpath/[https://restfulapi.net/json-jsonpath/]

And this is where the oc command becomes incredibly powerful. Type the following:

[source]
----
oc get dc -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'
----

Note that the command does not append a newline so the output will appear next to your command prompt.

We can use the output of an object in json through a jsonpath filter and access *any* component of the object. Here's a more useful example - type the following:

[source]
----
for pod in $(oc get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); \
do echo $pod; \
echo "  "$(oc get pod $pod -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'); \
done
----

image::ocintro10.png[manual pod listing]

What we will do now is to scale down *all* of the applications to a single Pod using the oc command - this may seem a little pithy but imagine if you had operations to run over hundreds or thousands of objects. This approach makes it very easy to automate tasks. Type the following:

[source]
----
for dc in $(oc get deploymentconfig -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); \
do oc scale dc/$dc --replicas=1; \
done

oc get pods | grep Running
----

This command will scale *all* of the deployment configs to one copy.

The oc command gives access to *all* the objects available for the logged on User. In the case of a standard user, such as the one we are using for this lab, this will be the objects created in the namespace. In the case of what is called a 'Cluster Admin' user this is effectively all the objects in the entire system. 

=== Cleanup the lab

We will finally use the oc command to clean the project. Type the following:

[source]
----
oc delete project octest-{{USER_ID}}
----
