If you are not already logged on go to the UI URL {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[{{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}, window="_blank"] and logon as '{{USER_ID}}' and password openshift. 

If you do not already have a terminal tab running as defined in the pre-requisites please open one following the instructions in the pre-requisites

Ensure you are on the Administrator View (top level, select Administrator)

In the UI click on 'Home/Projects'

Click on 'Create Project'

For the project name give it rbactest-{{USER_ID}}

Display Name and Description are optional

Click on 'Create'

=== Examining Service Accounts

Once the project has been created, click on 'User Management/Service Accounts'

image::rbac-1.png[List of Service Accounts]

TIP: Service Accounts are effectively virtual users - even though you have logged on when you do anything within the namespace, such as a build or a deployment, the namespace uses a virtual user, with appropriate permissions, to do the actual tasks internally, like pushing a built image to the registry, or pulling an image to start a Container.

*Each project gets a Service Account by default, named default or to give it its full name system:serviceaccount:rbactestx:default (where x is your number). There are also Service Accounts for doing the appropriate actions, such as Builder and Deployer*

*In addition further Service Accounts can be created by the project owner and given additional security details and roles, such as being able to execute Containers as root, or giving Containers specific controlled sec-comp profiles (like changing the Group ID for the process)*

Switch to the Developer view using the top left pulldown

In the Topology Tab click on ‘From Catalog’

In the search box enter ‘node’. Select the Node.js option (Builder Image)

Click ‘Create Application’

Default the Builder Image Version to version 12

For the git repo enter ‘https://github.com/utherp0/nodenews’

Insure the UI displays 'Validated' beneath the URL textbox when you unfocus. If it doesn't check the URL

Set the Application Name to ‘rbac’

Set the Name to ‘rbactest’

In Resources set the deployment to DeploymentConfig

Click 'Create'

Click on the Node pod indicator so the informational panel appears

Watch the build and ensure it completes

Once the build is complete ensure the deployment occurs. The Pod ring will turn dark blue

Click on User Management/Role Bindings

image::rbac-2.png[Admin Role]

<<<<<<< HEAD:labs/rbac.adoc
TIP: Note that we have one Role Binding shown at the moment, which is for Admin and applies to a kind of 'user' and a subject name of '{{USER_ID}}'. This is the binding of your user to the administration role within the project.

Set the filter for the tab to show only the 'System Role Bindings'

image::rbac-3.png[System Role Bindings]

<<<<<<< HEAD:labs/rbac.adoc
TIP: Note that with the addition of System Role Bindings to the screen we can now see the three Service Accounts also created. Deployer is part of the system:deployers binding, builder is part of the system:image-builders binding and the group of users under system:serviceaccounts:rbactest-{{USER_ID}} have the system:image-pullers binding.
