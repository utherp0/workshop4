=== Introduction

.OpenShift Serverless
****
OpenShift Serverless, based on Knative is the serverless technology that was introduced in OpenShift 4.2. OpenShift Serverless enables Pods running on OpenShift to be scaled to 0 therefore taking zero processing power. Only when called, OpenShift Serverless will scale the Pod up on demand before processing the request. OpenShift Serverless also has the ability to autoscale based on load before eventually scaling back to zero when no requests are being received. 

OpenShift Serverless supports "Serving" and "Eventing"

At the time of writing, Eventing is in Technology Preview

"Serving" enables request/response workloads, and Eventing enables asynchronous event based workloads using cloudevents. 

Eventing has become an important part of a Microservice architecture. It enables services to notify other services of change (typically, change in state) in a loosely coupled manner. To enable this, Knative Eventing uses a publish and subscribe architecture. This enables the source service to publish events without having the knowledge of who maybe wanting to consume the events. It allows any number of sink services to subscribe to the event and act upon it. 

In this lab, we are going to look at eventing, and how easy it is to integration with Camel K.
****

=== Check the project is ready to use

In the browser based terminal window, check you are still logged on and using the correct project by typing:

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc project
----

TIP: If the response from the commands indicates that you are not {{USER_ID}} and not using the project sandboxX please repeat the commands in the pre-requisites.

Whilst OpenShift Serverless has it's own cli (kn), the purpose of this lab is to show the integration of Camel K into OpenShift Serverless and how easy this is to use. 

=== OpenShift Serverless and the Operator Lifecycle Manager

.OpenShift Serverless and the Operator Lifecycle Manager
****
OpenShift Serverless uses the Operator Lifecycle manager, this means that its operator and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) will be added to OpenShift via "OLM". Once created, the new CRDs will extend the OpenShift data model allowing OpenShift Serverless to be managed using the standard ‘oc’ command. Installing operators requires a higher cluster privilege so the presenter will have already set these up for you.
****

=== Creating the pre-requisites for the chapter

Before we can create an integration, we need to check that the camel-k integration added in a previous chapter is still active

In the terminal window, type

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/attendee/camelfiles/camelkplatform
oc apply -f integrationplatform.yaml
----

This will either create the integration platform or, if it is still active, indicate it is unchanged

now type

[source]
----
oc get integrationplatform
----

The output should look similar to below

[source]
----
NAME      PHASE
camel-k   Ready
----

Once the "Phase" says "Ready", you can continue

=== Create Knative Messaging Channel 

OpenShift Serverless uses Knative eventing. Knative eventing is a loosely coupled asynchronous architecture allowing event producers to send an event to one or more event consumers. Event Consumers can be scaled to zero when no events are following through the system.

By default, Knative uses an in-memory messaging channel. In this lab we will configure two of these channels to use with Camel K

Options are also available to replace in-memory messaging with other event sources such as the Kafka Channel. By combining Camel K and Red Hat AMQ Streams (Red Hat's Kafka Implementation) on OpenShift you create a powerful and reliable cloud native eventing platform for your applications.

In the browser terminal window type the following:

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples/knative
oc apply -f messages-channel.yaml
oc apply -f words-channel.yaml
----

To make sure the channels have been created correctly type:

[source]
----
oc get inmemorychannel
----

You should see a screenshot like the one below

image::camekknative-4.png[InMemory Channels Ready]

You are looking for 'READY' to be 'True'

=== Deploy the Integrations

.Introduction to the integrations that we will use
****
Now that we have deployed 2 message channels, we will deploy 3 Camel K Integrations. 'feed.groovy' will generate a simple sentence every 3 seconds, and send this to the 'message channel', 'splitter.groovy' will subscribe to the 'message channel', take the message, split the message into individual words before sending the individual words to 'words channel'. Finally, 'printer.groovy' will subscribe to the 'words.channel', read the words from the channel and print them to the output log.

The flow looks like:

image::knative-eventing.png[align="center"]

****

In the terminal window, deploy the 3 integrations

[source]
----
kamel run feed.groovy
kamel run splitter.groovy
kamel run printer.groovy
----

First go to the Administrator view in the OpenShift console - at the top left make sure the view is set to Administrator

Go to Workloads/Pods. As you are using a single namespace for the workshop this should display the Pods in sandboxX, where X is your user number

Watch as the integrations are created using builder and deployment containers. This may take a little while. Your screen with eventually look simlar to the one below.

image::camekknative-11.png[Containers building]

TIP: The screenshot above shows you pods in all their states e.g. completed, running, terminated etc. To just view the running pods, click on "filter" (top left hand side of the table listing the pods) and check the box "running"

Once it has finished deploying the integrations you will have three Pods active as shown similar to the screenshot below (ignore the devex Pod, this is your terminal Pod)

image::camekknative-12.png[Containers Complete]

Now go to the developer view in the OpenShift Console

Now that all 3 of the Integrations are deployed, the topology view should look like the screenshot below

image::camekknative-5.png[Integrations running]

TIP: The Knative service is represented  by the name "KSVC" and "REV". You should see 2 of these in the topology view. On each of the Knative Services you will see the Knative "K" logo just to the left of the letters "KSVC". You definitely know that you have a Knative service now.  "KSVC" is the Knative Service defined to OpenShift. The artefact called "REV", is the Knative revision that is current running. Revisions can be used to implement a Canary Release strategy. The diagram shows that 100% of the traffic is routed to the revision shown on the topology view. If you click on one of the "KSVC" on the topology view you will see an option to set the traffic distribution

Each of the integrations is producing log information. 

Lets view the logs of each of the running integrations. To view a log, simple click inside any of the square boxes. You should see a screen similar to the one below.

image::camekknative-6.png[Viewing overview of running Integration]

Click on "View Logs" to see the log for the integration

Repeat the steps above for the other Integrations if you like.

=== Edit the Integration to use a Counter and Cache

NOTE:: Because the output from the Feed Integation doesn't change, it's hard to see if all the messages are being processed, or indeed if some are being dropped. Lets make a small change to the Integration. The change will add a cache, and a counter to ensure that each message has a counter in it. 

In the terminal window edit the Integration called feed.groovy

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples/knative
vi feed.groovy
----

Between the line starting with *from* and the line starting with *.setBody* insert the follow code (copy the code by higlightling it and copying it)

[source]
----
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineAction", constant("GET"))
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineKey", constant("count"))
        .toF("caffeine-cache://%s", "messagecount")
        .choice()
                .when().simple('${body} == null') // When no counter stored, default to zero
                        .setHeader('counter').constant(0)
                .otherwise() // retrieve the counter
                        .setHeader('counter').simple('${body}')
        .end()
        .setHeader('counter').ognl('request.headers.counter + 1')
        .setBody().simple('${header.counter}')
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineAction", constant("PUT"))
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineKey", constant("count"))
        .toF("caffeine-cache://%s", "messagecount")
        .setBody().simple('Hello${header.counter} World${header.counter} from${header.counter} Camel${header.counter} K${header.counter}')
----

TIP:: I'm no vi expert, but if you don't know vi, use the keyboard arrow keys to move to the line beginning with *from*, then to go to the end of the line press *$*, press *i*, press the *right arrow* once to move the cursor to the end of the line and press *enter* ( this shoud insert a blank line and move the cursor to the beginning of that line. Paste in the code by pressing *ctrl v*. Don't worry about the indentation too much. Once pasted in press *esc*. 

The final line pasted in is *.setBody*. There is an existing *.setBody* line that we need to delete, the line looks like :-

[source]
----
.setBody().constant("Hello World from Camel K")
----

TIP:: To delete, move the cursor to the line and press *dd* Finally save your work by typing *:wq* and press *enter*

Once complete, the integration should look like :-

from('timer:clock?period=3s')
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineAction", constant("GET"))
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineKey", constant("count"))
        .toF("caffeine-cache://%s", "messagecount")
        .choice()
                .when().simple('${body} == null') // When no counter stored, default to zero
                        .setHeader('counter').constant(0)
                .otherwise() // retrieve the counter
                        .setHeader('counter').simple('${body}')
        .end()
        .setHeader('counter').ognl('request.headers.counter + 1')
        .setBody().simple('${header.counter}')
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineAction", constant("PUT"))
        .setHeader("CamelCaffeineKey", constant("count"))
        .toF("caffeine-cache://%s", "messagecount")
        .setBody().simple('Hello${header.counter} World${header.counter} from${header.counter} Camel${header.counter} K${header.counter}')
        .to('knative:channel/messages')
        .log('sent message to messages channel')
----

Each word should now have the counter appended to it

Test your work by typing :-

[source]
----
kamel run feed.groovy
----

Use the skills you've learned to view the output of the container logs to check that the messages now contain a counter.

=== Knative in action

Make sure you are in the developer view of the console, looking at the Topology view before continuing

The 2 Integrations "hooked" into Knative Eventing are the 'splitter' and 'printer' integrations (you can visually see this on the topology view). 

Let's see if the promise of scale to zero works.

To stop the integrations, we need to stop messages arriving at the "messages.channel". To do this, we need to stop the feed integration.

In the terminal browser window, type

[source]
----
kamel delete feed
----

Go back to the topology view, you will notice that the feed integration has gone. 

image::camekknative-13.png[No Feed]

Show some patience now, keep looking at the topology view, we are waiting (and hoping!) that the integrations scale down to zero.

You will know when this starts as the rings around the circles will change from the normal blue to a very dark blue, before going white. Once they are white, the integrations are scaled to zero just like the screenshot below

image::camekknative-10.png[Scaled to zero]

To wake the Integrations up again, redeploy the 'feed' integration.

[source]
----
kamel run feed.groovy
----

Go back to the topology view and you should see the 'feed' integration redeploy, and the 'splitter' and 'printer' integrations awake from their slumber.

This shows the potential for effective serverless behaviour by the down-scaling of unused applications, combined with the ease of Camel-K integrations.

To clean up before the next chapter run the following commands in the terminal:

[source]
----
kamel delete feed
kamel delete splitter
kamel delete printer
----

 === Replace Knative in-memory messaging with AMQ Streams (Kafka)

.Introduction
****

You may have noticed that the default Knative event channel is in-memory. This means that there is the potential for message loss in the solution, and also the potential for some subscribers to miss messages.

Most applications need some form of persistent messaging, avoiding message loss in the event of something going wrong. A popular choice in the microservice world for publish and subscribe eventing is Apache Kafka. In addition to the InMemoryChannel used in the first part of this lab, Knative also has a channel type called KafkaChannel. As the name suggests, this allows Knative Eventing to use a Kafka Topic as the persistent store for the messages ensuring the reliable delivery to all subscribers. 

So, we can use Kafka as a persistent store, but how do we get a Kafka Cluster installed on OpenShift?

Red Hat has an operator based Enterprise Kafka distribution called AMQ Streams. AMQ Streams is based on the open source project Strimzi (https://strimzi.io[https://strimzi.io, window="_blank"]). At the time of writing, Strimzi is a sandbox project within CNCF.

Using Kafka behind Knative eventing means that developers also get access to the full Kafka eco-system. Change Data capture could be used to publish messages that are consumed by Knative eventing clients. Kafka clients such as the streaming API could be used to read messages published by Knative based services. All Kafka API's and services could be used as part of the solution. 
****

Before you can continue, you need to delete the in-memory channels created earlier in the lab. 

[source]
----
oc delete inmemorychannel messages
oc delete inmemorychannel words
----

Double check that the inmemorychannels have been successfully deleted

[source]
----
oc get inmemorychannels
----

The output should look like :-

[source]
----
No resources found in sandbox-{{USER_ID}} namespace.
----

==== Install a Kafka Broker using AMQ Streams

NOTE: AMQ Streams using an Operator to perform all of the administration tasks on OpenShift. The operator is already installed for you and makes available a number of new Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). These are Kafka, KafkaBridge, KafkaConnect, KafkaConnectS2I, KafkaConnector, KafkaMirrorMaker, KafkaMirrorMaker2, KafkaTopic, and KafkaUser. As you can see, the AMQ Streams operater has a rich set of functionality. All of the configuration work can be performed throught the operator without detailed knowledge of Kafka Installations. You will see in the next step how easy it is to create an Kafka cluster, including the Kafka Brokers and Zookeeper clusters, with one simple YAML file.

Once the operators are installed, the CRDs become available for you to use through the developer view in the OpenShift console.

In the OpenShift console, make sure you in developer view looking at your sandbox-{{USER_ID}} project.

This should look similar to the screenshot below 

image::camekknative-14.png[Developer Console]

Click on "+Add"

image::camekknative-15.png[Add]

You will see "From Catalog" on the screenshot above, 'click' on it 

This will present you with the developer catalog. 

Underneath the words "All Items" you will see a text box that says "Filter by keyword"

In that text box, type "kafka"

You should see a screenshot similar to the one below

image::camekknative-16.png[Kafka in Catalog]

'Click' on Kafka

'Press' the Create button

You will now be presented with a sample Kafka yaml file that looks similar to the screenshot below 

image::camekknative-17.png[Sample Kafka yaml]

Due to the number of workshop attendees and the size of the OpenShift cluster we need to make the Kafka deployment smaller by reducing the number of Kafka Brokers in the cluster to 1, and the number of zookeeper instances to 1. 

To do this, change 

[source]
----
spec.kafka.replicas: 1
----

and

[source]
----
spec.zookeeper.replicas: 1
----

Because the kafka brokers are now set to one replica, you have to modify the configuration elements below

[source]
----
offset.topic.replication.factor: 1

transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1

transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
----

Your final Kafka yaml file should look like :-

[source]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: sandbox-{{USER_ID}}
spec:
  kafka:
    version: 2.4.0
    replicas: 1
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
      log.message.format.version: '2.4'
    storage:
      type: ephemeral
  zookeeper:
    replicas: 1
    storage:
      type: ephemeral
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
----

Press 'Create'.

You will be presented with a screen that looks similar to the screenshot below. (This is looking at the AMQ Streams operator)

image::camekknative-18.png[AMQ Streams Operator]

If you click on "my-cluster", you can see the current state of the Kafka deployment by scrolling to the bottom of the screen

Underneath Conditions, you are looking for 

Type       Status
Ready      True

It should like the screenshot below 

image::camekknative-19.png[AMQ Streams Status]

You can also go back to the Developer view in the console. You will see the Zookeeper and Kafka Brokers starting up. Once everything is started it should look similar to the screenshot below.

image::camekknative-20.png[AMQ Streams Topology View]

==== Install Knative Kafka Eventing

Note:  Knative Kafka is operator based, the operator has been installed previously for you so the installation should be straight forward

The CRD for Knative Kafka is called "KnativeEventingKafka", you need to add a CRD to your namespace to integrate Knative eventing with Kafka. 

Firstly,

You need to find the bootstrap server of your Kafka Cluster.

To do this, go to the terminal window and type 

[source]
----
oc get services 
----

You will see a list of services similar to the list below

[source]
----
NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
devex4                        ClusterIP   172.30.227.91    <none>        8080/TCP                     3h55m
my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap    ClusterIP   172.30.67.254    <none>        9091/TCP,9092/TCP,9093/TCP   65m
my-cluster-kafka-brokers      ClusterIP   None             <none>        9091/TCP,9092/TCP,9093/TCP   65m
my-cluster-zookeeper-client   ClusterIP   172.30.178.174   <none>        2181/TCP                     66m
my-cluster-zookeeper-nodes    ClusterIP   None             <none>        2181/TCP,2888/TCP,3888/TCP   66m
----

You are after the service name ending in "bootstrap" - make a note of it as you will need it in the next step 

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/attendee/camelfiles/streams
----

Create a KnativeEventing Kafka CRD

[source]
----
vi mykafkaknative.yaml
----

Paste the following into the file, ensuring you replace the bootstrapServer with the one you noted above. Please make sure you keep the single quotes in the file.

[source]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventingKafka
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing-kafka
  namespace: sandbox-{{USER_ID}}
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'replacewithyourbootstrapserver:9092'
  setAsDefaultChannelProvisioner: true

----

Once you have changed the bootstrapserver, save the file

You can now store the CRD into OpenShift by typing the following :-

[source]
----
oc apply -f mykafkaknative.yaml
----

This will now perform perform the Integration between Knative Eventing and Kafka

To check the status of the Integration, type

[source]
----
oc describe KnativeEventingKafka knative-eventing-kafka
----

The output will look similar to below 

[source]
----

----

Very near the bottom of the output, it should say Type = Ready. This means that you are good to go.

//// 
////

Note:: To use AMQ Streams, you will use a different channel - the new channel you are going to use is called KafkaChannel. There is also a little bug at present, when you create the channels, the actual Kafka Topics will be created in the Central Broker, rather than your own. If you want to see this then please ask the instructor. 

==== Run the examples

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/camelfiles/streams
----

Before you can do work with Kafka, we need to configure the Knative Kafka dispatcher. You need to add a configmap called config-kafka to your project

edit the configmap and change the namespace to your own namespace *sandboxXX*
[source]
----
vi config-kafka.yaml
----

The configmap should look similar to the one below :-

[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: config-kafka
  namespace: sandboxXX
data:
  # Broker URL. Replace this with the URLs for your kafka cluster,
  # which is in the format of my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-kafka-namespace:9092.
  bootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap
----

[source]
----
oc apply -f config-kafka.yaml
----

Create the "messages" Knative Eventing channel backed by Kafka as a persistent store. Please edit the messages.yaml file and change the namespace to your own

[source]
----
vi messages.yaml
----

Create the KafkaChannel on Openshift

[source]
----
oc apply -f messages.yaml
----

Lets make sure that everything appears to be wired up.

Check to make sure that the Kafka channel is deployed and ready

Type

[source]
----
oc get kafkachannel
----

If everything worked as expected, you should see the output similar to below (This might take a couple of minutes the first time - Openshift is pulling and starting up the dispatcher)

[source]
----
NAME       READY   REASON   URL                                                     AGE
messages   True             http://messages-kn-channel.sandbox30.svc.cluster.local   47s
----

OK, so the above output suggests that the channel is ready and working.

Lets make sure that a topic has been created in Kafka for us.

If you recall, the AMQ streams operator has a number of different CRDs, therefore the creation of the Knative Channel should have created a KafkaTopic CRD. Let's check to make sure that's the case.

Type 

[source]
----
oc get kafkatopics 
----

The output should look similar to below 

[source]
----
NAME                                         PARTITIONS   REPLICATION FACTOR
knative-messaging-kafka.sandbox30.messages   1            1
----

This goes to show that the Kafka Topic has successfully been created with the number of partitions and replication factor that was asked for when creating the channel.

If you are more comfortable using the Kafka CLI, then you still have access to this within the Kafka statefulset. 

Assuming you did not change the name of your Kafka Cluster then the stateful set should be called "my-cluster-kafka-0"

If you did change the name of the cluster, then please change the name of the statefulset accordingly.

Type

[source]
----
oc exec -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list
----

The output should look like the following 

[source]
----
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: If the number of processors is expected to increase from one, then you should configure the number of parallel GC threads appropriately using -XX:ParallelGCThreads=N
knative-messaging-kafka.sandbox30.messages
----

It confirms that there is a topic called knative-messaging-kafka.sandbox30.messages defined to the cluster. 

And finally, you can check how the topic is laid out in the cluster (Not so exciting as there is only one broker)

Type

[source]
----
oc exec -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181  --topic knative-messaging-kafka.sandboxX.messages
----

The output should look like the following

[source]
----OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: If the number of processors is expected to increase from one, then you should configure the number of parallel GC threads appropriately using -XX:ParallelGCThreads=N

This shows that 1 partition has been created. ISR is zero because the replication factor is 1. The partition is not being replicated. This is not recommended for production. This is purely to limit the resources on our OpenShift cluster. 


Lets deploy the second channel called 'words' again, this time based on a Kafka Channel

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/camelfiles/streams
----

Create the "words" Knative Eventing channel backed by Kafka as a persistent store. Please edit the words.yaml file and change the namespace to your own

[source]
----
vi words.yaml
----

Create the KafkaChannel on Openshift

[source]
----
oc apply -f words.yaml
----

[source]
----
oc get kafkachannels
----

The output should look similar to that below 

[source]
----
NAME       READY   REASON   URL                                                      AGE
messages   True             http://messages-kn-channel.sandbox30.svc.cluster.local   25m
words      True             http://words-kn-channel.sandbox30.svc.cluster.local      8s

We are now going to re-run exactly the same integrations that we used earlier in the lab, as a reminder, this is what the flow looks like

image::knative-eventing.png[align="center"]

Make sure you are in the "Topology view" within the OpenShift console so you can see things deploy and run. 

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples/knative
----

Run the Integration that starts everything off 

[source]
----
kamel run feed.groovy
----

If you look at the log in the running pod for the feed applicaion you should see that messages it's creating (If you cannot remember how to do this, review the instructions for the first part of this lab)

Return to the Topology view

Now run the Splitter Integration
[source]
----
kamel run splitter.groovy
----

Now run the Printer Integration
[source]
----
kamel run printer.groovy
----

Take a look at the log file for the splitter Integration, you will notice something a bit weird

The splitter is outputting the message like this :-

The Kafka client used has serialized the messages into Base64... not so helpful for this little example.

We can fix this by making a small change to the 'splitter.groovy' integration. This will allow the integration to transform the Base64 back to normal ascii text

Type

[source]
----
vi splitter.groovy 
----

The integration will look like 

[source]
----
from('knative:channel/messages')
  .split().tokenize(" ")
  .log('sending ${body} to words channel')
  .to('knative:channel/words')
----

Before it does the ".split", add a new line and insert 

[source]
----
.unmarshal().base64()
----

The line above with transform from Base64 to a Java byte array. 
The integration should now look like 

[source]
----
from('knative:channel/messages')
  .unmarshal().base64()
  .split().tokenize(" ")
  .log('sending ${body} to words channel')
  .to('knative:channel/words')
----

redeploy the integration

Type

[source]
----
kamel run --dependency=camel-base64 splitter.groovy
----

You will notice that the Camel Base64 dependency has been added, this enables Camel K to download the dependency and package it into the runtime

Check the pods log again, you should be able to read the text again

If you look at the printer Integration log, you will notice that it has exactly the same problem.

See if you can fix the problem for this integration by following the same steps above. The name of the file is printer.groovy

==== Accessing the Kafka Topics directly 

In the terminal window, type :-

[source]
----
oc exec -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic knative-messaging-kafka.sandboxX.messages --from-beginning
----

There you go, all the messaging sent using Knative eventing channels available in a Kafka topic. This means that all the events flying around the event driven network can also be made available to many other tools supported by Kafka. This could be big data systems, AI systems, mirroring events to different Kafka Clusters and many more things. Of course, the biggest benefit is that the events are now persisted, partitioned for scale, and replicated using classic Kafka functionality. 

Please clean up before moving on:-

Delete Kafka channels and Kafka cluster

[source]
----
oc delete kafkachannel messages words
oc delete kafka my-cluster
----

Delete Camel K Integrations
[source]
----
kamel delete feed splitter printer
----

Delete Knative Eventing Kafka dispatcher
[source]
----
oc delete deployment kafka-ch-dispatcher
