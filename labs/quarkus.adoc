=== Introduction

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called link:https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot, window="_blank"] and offers a unified imperative and reactive programming model and a number of other developer features like Live Reload to bring real joy to your development.

Throughout this lab you’ll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive. You will be using link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Red Hat CodeReady Workspace, window="_blank"], an online IDE based on CodeReady Workspaces. Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

==== Setting up your workspace environment

To get started, open your `crw` project, and open the CodeReady url.

On the login page, select `Register`. You will have to register a new user before proceeding. Enter the following in the respective fields:

[source]
----
First name: user{{USER_ID}}
Last name: user{{USER_ID}}
Email: user{{USER_ID}}@no-reply.com
Username: user{{USER_ID}}
Password: openshift
Confirm password: openshift
----

Once you log in with your username and password, you will be placed on the Get Started page. It gives you a view of the different projects that you can create create or pre-configure.

You will now create a Quarkus workspace to use. Select the `Custom Workspace` tab.

In the `Workspace Name` field, enter the workspace name:

[source]
----
quarkus-lab
----

In the `devfile` section, select the 'URL of devfile' field and enter the following devfile URL:

[source]
----
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akouao/quarkus-lab/devfile/devfile.yaml
----

NOTE: Devfiles are YAML files that are consumed and transformed into a cloud workspace composed of multiple containers. The devfile can be saved in the root folder of a Git repository, a feature branch of a Git repository, a publicly accessible destination, or as a separate, locally stored artifact.

Hit the `Load devfile` button to ensure that the configuration is loaded.


image::quarkus-1.png[View of interface with populated workspace name and imported devfile]


That's it. Your workspace configuration is complete. Scroll to the bottom of the page. Click `Create and Open`. After a minute or two, you will be placed in the workspace.

Users of Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code will see a familiar layout: a project/file browser on the left, a code editor on the right, and a terminal at the bottom. You’ll use all of these during the course of this workshop, so keep this browser tab open throughout. Feel free to close the three tabs titled `Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces`.

TIP: If things get weird, you can simply reload the browser tab to refresh the view.

Ready? Let’s go!

==== Getting Started with Quarkus

In this step, you will create a straightforward application serving a `hello` endpoint. To demonstrate dependency injection, this endpoint uses a `greeting` bean.


image::quarkus-2.png[Restful greeting service process]


You can see icons on the left for navigating between project explorer, search and other plugins. You’ll use these during the course of this workshop. Feel free to click on them and see what they do:


image::quarkus-3.png[Workspace icons on the left pane]


Many features of CodeReady Workspaces are accessed via Commands. You can see a few of the commands listed with links on the home page (e.g. New File.., Git Clone.., and others).

TIP: If you ever need to run commands that you don’t see in a menu, you can press F1 to open the command window, or the more traditional `Control+SHIFT+P` (or `Command+SHIFT+P on Mac OS X`).

===== Locate the project

What you will discover in this section includes:

* The Maven structure
* An `org.acme.rest.GreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`, along with a simple test
* A landing page that is accessible on http://localhost:8080 after starting the application
* The application configuration file
* Other source files we’ll use later

Click on the project explorer icon on the left panel. Navigate to `quarkus-lab` → `getting-started` → `src` → `main` → `java` → `org.acme.rest` in the project tree and double click on `GreetingResource.java`:


image::quarkus-4.png[GreetingResource.java location]


This class has a very simple RESTful endpoint definition:

[source]
----
@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

It’s a very simple REST endpoint, returning "hello" to requests on `/hello`.

TIP: Compared to vanilla JAX-RS, with Quarkus there is no need to create an Application class. It’s supported but not required. In addition, only one instance of the resource is created and not one per request. You can configure this using the different *Scoped annotations (ApplicationScoped, RequestScoped, etc).

===== Running the Application in Live Coding Mode

Live Coding (also referred to as dev mode) allows us to run the app and make changes on the fly. Quarkus will automatically re-compile and reload the app when changes are made. This is a powerful and efficient style of developing that you will use throughout the lab.

You can always use the `mvn` (Maven) commands to run Quarkus apps, but we’ve created a few helpful shortcuts under the `quarkus-tools` subheading on the right - by cliking the cube icon - to run various Maven commands.

TIP: The location of the various Maven commands will be referred to as quarkus-tools from now on.

Start the app by clicking on Start Live Coding in quarkus-tools:

TIP: You only need to click the button once.


image::quarkus-5.png[Selection of Live Coding Button]


This will compile and run the app using `mvn compile quarkus:dev` in a Terminal window. Leave this terminal window open throughout the lab! You will complete the entire lab without shutting down Quarkus Live Coding mode, so be careful not to close the tab (if you do, you re-run it). This is very useful for quick experimentation.

You should see:

[source]
----
2020-06-10 13:43:27,145 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) people 1.0-SNAPSHOT (running on Quarkus x.x.x) started in 1.389s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
2020-06-10 13:43:27,145 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated.
2020-06-10 13:43:27,146 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cdi, resteasy]
----

Note the amazingly fast startup time! The app is now running "locally" (within the Che container in which the workspace is also running). `localhost` refers to the Kubernetes pod, not "your" laptop (so therefore opening localhost:8080 in your browser will not do anything).

CodeReady will also detect that the Quarkus app opens port `5005` (for debugging) and `8080` (for web requests). Do NOT open port `5005`, but when prompted, open the port 8080, which opens a small web browser in CodeReady:

TIP: Close all pop-up dialog boxes that appear on the bottom right of your screen.


image::quarkus-6.png[Dialog box for port 8080]


You should see the default Quarkus welcome page on the right-hand side of your workspace (you may need to click the reload icon).

Open a new CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:


image::quarkus-7.png[Selection of New Nerminal button]


and invoke the hello endpoint using the following curl command:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello
----

You can also click on the URL link labelled `web-development` - located in quarkus-tools - in a separate browser tab.

Add `/hello` to the URL in your browser to see the same result as the curl command.

image::quarkus-8.png[Hello endpoint in browser]


Now, let’s exercise the live reload capabilities of Quarkus. In CodeReady, open the `GreetingResource.java` file (in `src/main/java/org/acme/rest`) remove the line `return "hello";` in the editor. Now insert the line `“return hola";`. 

After making this change, reload the same browser tab that was showing `hello`.

As you may have guessed from the red squigglies earlier, an error has occurred. One common complaint from Java developers is that the most meaningful information about the stack is displayed last on the terminal. Fortunately with Quarkus, the order is reversed; you see the meaningful information right away!

Here, we can see that the error states that line 19 `"return hola"` is not a statement.

Return to `GreetingResource.java` file (in `src/main/java/org/acme/rest`) file. Change:

[source]
----
"return hola";
----

to

[source]
----
return "hola";
----

TIP: Pay careful attention to where you put the quotation marks this time!

Now reload the same browser tab that was showing the error. Now try it with the `/hello` endpoint appended.

Wow, how cool is that? Supersonic Subatomic live reload! Go ahead and change it a few more times and access the endpoint again. And we’re just getting started. Leave the app running so we can continue to change it on the fly in the next section.

TIP: `quarkus:dev` runs Quarkus in development mode. This enables live reload with background compilation, which means that when you modify your Java files your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.

TIP: This will also listen for a debugger on port `5005`. If you want to wait for the debugger to attach before running you can pass `-Ddebug` on the command line. If you don’t want the debugger at all you can use `-Ddebug=false`.

Open the `GreetingResource.java` file (in `src/main/java/org/acme/rest`) and return:

[source]
----
return "hola;
----

to

[source]
----
return "hello";
----

===== Package the Application

Quarkus apps can be packaged as an executable JAR file or a native binary. We’ll cover native binaries later, so for now, let’s package as an executable JAR.

Click on `Package Application` in quarkus-tools.

This produces an executable jar file in the `quarkus-lab` → `getting-started` → `target` directory:


image::quarkus-9.png[Produced .jar file in /target directory]


`getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` - being an executable jar. Be aware that it’s not an über-jar as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

===== Running the executable JAR

Run the packaged application. In a Terminal - which you can open in quarkus-tools - run the following command:

[source]
----
java -Dquarkus.http.port=8081 -jar $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-lab/getting-started/target/*-runner.jar
----

TIP: We use -Dquarkus.http.port=8081 to avoid conflicting with port 8080 used for Live Coding mode

With the app running on the terminal, open a separate terminal window (do not close the current one!), and ensure the app is running by executing a `curl` command:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/hello
----

You should see:

[source]
----
hello
----

===== Cleanup

Go back to the terminal in which you ran the app with `java -jar` and stop the app by pressing `CTRL+C`. Be sure not to close the "Live Coding" terminal!

TIP: Close all terminal windows, and file windows, except for the "Live Coding" terminal

===== Congratulations!

You’ve seen how to build a basic app, package it as an executable JAR and start it up very quickly. The JAR file can be used like any other executable JAR file (e.g. running it as-is, packaging as a Linux container, etc.)

==== Dependency Injection

In the previous step you created a basic RESTful Java application with Quarkus. In this step we’ll add a custom bean using dependency injection (DI). Quarkus DI solution is based on the link:https://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html[Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0 specification, window="_blank].

===== Add Custom Bean

Let’s modify the application and add a companion bean. In CodeReady, navigate to `quarkus-lab` → `getting-started` → `src` → `main` → `java` → `org.acme.service` in the project tree and double click on `GreetingService.java` in the project browser.

Next, copy the below code into the `GreetingService.java` class:

[source]
----
package org.acme.service;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class GreetingService {
    private String hostname = System.getenv().getOrDefault("HOSTNAME", "unknown");
    public String greeting(String name) {
        return "hello " + name + " from " + hostname;
    }
}
----

This is an injectable bean that implements a `greeting()` method returning a string `hello <hostname>` (where `<hostname>` is the Linux hostname of the machine on which the code runs).

Next, open the existing `GreetingResource.java` file (in the `org.acme.people.rest` package) and add the following method underneath

[source]
----
public static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingResource.class);
----

[source]
----
@Inject
GreetingService service;
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Path("/greeting/{name}")
public String greeting(@PathParam("name") String name) {
    return service.greeting(name);
}
----

TIP: Pay careful attention to the class names. We are currently using both the GreetingResource AND GreetingService class.

Your `GreetingResource.java` file should look like this so far:

[source]
----
package org.acme.rest;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {

    public static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingResource.class);

    @Inject
    GreetingService service;
    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Path("/greeting/{name}")
    public String greeting(@PathParam("name") String name) {
        return service.greeting(name);
    }

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

This will cause our new `GreetingResource` class to be instantiated and injected as the `service` field, and then the method `greeting` accesses this service to return the name.

You will get red error squigglies when you paste this code due to missing import statements:


image::quarkus-10.png[Added method to GreetingResource.java with missing imports]


Add the necessary imports below the existing import statements near the top of the file, where the other existing imports are:

[source]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.acme.service.GreetingService;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
----

TIP: If you get red squigglies, or you can’t make them disappear, try to close the file and re-open it, or reload your web browser.

===== Inspect the results

Check that it works as expected by accessing the `/hello/greeting/quarkus` with curl on a new terminal:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/hello/greeting/quarkus
----

Note we are exercising our new bean using the `/hello/greeting/quarkus` endpoint, and you should see `hello quarkus from <hostname>`.
 
TIP: In this case, the hostname is the hostname from the pod the app is running on within Kubernetes and will change later on.

===== Cleanup

Close all terminal windows, and file windows, except for the "Start Live Coding" terminal

===== Congratulations!

It’s a familiar CDI-based environment for you Enterprise Java developers out there, with powerful mechanisms to reload your code as you type (or very close to realtime).

==== Building Native Quarkus Apps

Let’s now produce a native executable for our application. It improves the startup time of the application, and produces a minimal disk and memory footprint. The executable would have everything to run the application including the "JVM" (shrunk to be just enough to run the application), and the application. This is accomplished using link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM, window="_blank"].

GraalVM is a universal virtual machine for compiling and running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, JVM-based languages like Java, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin, Clojure, and LLVM-based languages such as C and C++. It includes ahead-of-time compilation, aggressive dead code elimination, and optimal packaging as native binaries that moves a lot of startup logic to build-time, thereby reducing startup time and memory resource requirements significantly.

image::quarkus-11.png[Native executable process]

GraalVM is already installed for you. Inspect the value of `GRAALVM_HOME` variable in the terminal with:

[source]
----
echo $GRAALVM_HOME
----

===== Build the Image

Within the `pom.xml` is the declaration for the Quarkus Maven plugin which contains a profile for `native-image`:

[source]
----
<profile>
  <id>native</id>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${quarkus-plugin.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>native-image</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <enableHttpUrlHandler>true</enableHttpUrlHandler>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    ...
<profile>
----

We use a profile because, you will see very soon, packaging the native image takes a few seconds. However, this compilation time is only incurred once, as opposed to every time the application starts, which is the case with other approaches for building and executing JARs.

Create a native executable by selecting `Build Native App` in quarkus-tools.

This will take about 3-4 minutes to finish. Wait for it!. In the end you should get a `BUILD SUCCESS` message.

TIP: Since we are on Linux in this environment, and the OS that will eventually run our application is also Linux, we can use our local OS to build the native Quarkus app. If you need to build native Linux binaries when on other OS’s like Windows or Mac OS X, you can use -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=[podman | docker]. You’ll need either Docker or Podman installed depending on which runtime you want to use!

In addition to the regular files, the build will produce `target/people-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`. This is a native Linux binary. Not a shell script, or a JAR file, but a native binary.

TIP: Close any pop-up dialog boxes that appear.

===== Run Native Image

Since our environment here is Linux, you can just run it. In the terminal, run:

[source]
----
$CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-lab/getting-started/target/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner -Dquarkus.http.port=8081
----

$CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-labs/target/people-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner -Dquarkus.http.port=8081 

TIP: We use port `8081` here to avoid conflicting with our already-running development mode Quarkus app.

Notice the amazingly fast startup time:

[source]
----
2019-07-10 18:52:44,607 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Quarkus xx.xx.xx started in 0.018s. Listening on: http://[::]:8081
----

That’s 18 milliseconds to start up.

TIP: Your startup time may vary.

And extremely low memory usage as reported by the Linux ps utility. While the app is running, open a new terminal and run:

[source]
----
ps -o pid,rss,command -p $(pgrep -f runner)
----

You should see something like:

[source]
----
PID   RSS COMMAND
 354 62648 /projects/quarkus-lab/getting-started/target/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner -Dquarkus.http.port=8081
----

This shows that our process is taking around 60 MB of memory (Resident Set Size, or RSS). Pretty compact!

TIP: The RSS and memory usage of any app, including Quarkus, will vary depending your specific environment, and will rise as the application experiences load.

Make sure the app is still working as expected (we’ll use `curl` this time to access it directly). In a new Terminal run:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/hello/greeting/quarkus
----

You should see:

[source]
----
hello quarkus from <your-hostname>
----

Nice!

===== Cleanup

Go to the Terminal in which you ran the native app and press `CTRL+C` to stop our native app. Be sure to leave your Live Coding Terminal open!

TIP: Close all terminal windows, and file windows, except for the "Start Live Coding" terminal

===== Congratulations!

You’ve now built a Java application as an executable JAR and a Linux native binary.

==== Documenting and Testing APIs

Exposing APIs has become an essential part of all modern applications. At the center of this revolution known as the API Economy we find RESTful APIs, which can transform any application into language agnostic services that can be called from anywhere: on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, etc.

This guide explains how your Quarkus application can expose its API description through an OpenAPI specification and how you can test it via a user-friendly UI named Swagger UI.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

Quarkus implements the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/[MicroProfile Open API Specification, window="_blank"] and as such exposes several developer APIs for documenting your application’s APIs.

The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification requires vendors to produce a valid OpenAPI document from pure JAX-RS 2.0 applications, without the developer adding any special annotations for OpenAPI. This means that vendors must process all the relevant JAX-RS annotations (such as `@Path` and `@Consumes`) as well as Java objects (POJOs) used as input or output to JAX-RS operations.

Therefore you as a developer get a lot of functionality out of the box without doing anything. Let’s test this out.

===== Add Extension

We need to add an extension for OpenAPI. Open a terminal on the right, and run the following command:

[source]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="openapi" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-lab/getting-started
----

This will add the necessary extension for using OpenAPI, and a graphical frontend extension called Swagger which we’ll discuss later. It also enables a new RESTful endpoint in the app accessible at `/openapi`.

Access the new endpoint using the following command in a Terminal:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/openapi
----

When prompted, open the port 8080.

This endpoint was created as part of the Quarkus OpenAPI Extension, and emits a programmatic description of your current endpoints as yaml (or json) in your terminal:

[source]
----
paths:
  /hello:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          content:
            text/plain:
              schema:
                type: string
  /hello/greeting/{name}:
    get:
      parameters:
      - name: name
        in: path
        required: true
        schema:
          type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          content:
            text/plain:
              schema:
                type: string
# ... and the rest of your endpoints
----

TIP: If you want JSON instead of YAML, use `curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/openapi`

So out of the box all your endpoints are fully documented and will be emitted in a programmatic format from the `/openapi` endpoint. CLIs are great, but for quick testing of APIs, wouldn’t it be great if that programmatic API was turned into an interactive, forms-based web page for quickly trying out endpoints? That’s what Swagger UI does.

TIP: If you were unable to link to the 8080 browser, click the web-development endpoint on the right.

===== Access Swagger UI

When building APIs, developers want to test them quickly. Swagger UI is a great tool for visualizing and interacting with your APIs. The UI is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification.

TIP: By default, Swagger UI is only available when Quarkus is started in dev or test mode. If you want to make it available in production too, you can include the following configuration in your application.properties: `quarkus.swagger-ui.always-include=true`.

Select the web-development endpoint to open the browser page.

Then, add

[source]
----
/swagger-ui
----

to the end of the URL to access the Swagger UI and play with your API.

Using the UI, expand the `/hello/greeting/{name}` endpoint. Here you can basic detail about the endpoint: the name of the endpoint, parameters and their type, and the response type one can expect.

Click the `Try it out` button to expand the box allowing you to try it. Enter any openshift into the name field and click Execute:


image::quarkus-12.png[Name input in Swagger UI]


This accesses the endpoint in the same way that `curl` does, and shows you the result (along with corresponding metadata in the HTTP response):


image::quarkus-13.png[Name response in Swagger UI]


Pretty handy way to test out your APIs!

TIP: Please note, the response body will vary. It should, however, follow the following format: `hello openshift from <your-hostname>`

===== Congratulations

In this exercise you learned more about the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification and how to use it to do in-place documentation of your RESTful microservice APIs.

There are additional types of documentation you can add, for example you can declare the security features and requirements of your API and then use these where appropriate in your paths and operations.

=== Final Cleanup

Finally, lets tidy up the cluster now that your introduction to Quarkus is complete. Navigate to your openshift terminal and enter the command

[source]
----
oc delete project crw-user{{USER_ID}}
----
