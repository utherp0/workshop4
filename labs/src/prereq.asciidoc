== Workshop Pre-requisites

=== Setting up the UI and Terminal

*The workshop was designed and tested on the Chrome browser and it is advised to avoid issues that this browser be used whenever possible*

TIP: For a number of the labs you will be interacting with the OpenShift cluster using a number of different command line tools. In order to avoid you having to install them on your own machine we have taken advantage of the nature of OpenShift and produced a Container that does it all for you, and provides a terminal experience in the browser. In this section you will create that application; this terminal is used throughout the workshop.

NOTE: If you leave the Terminal window open for a long time without using it it will disconnect. To reconnect simply refresh the page.

Open the browser and navigate to the console url {webConsoleUrl}[{webConsoleUrl}, window="_blank"]

Logon using the user provided by the course administrator (user*x* where *x* is a unique number for your session)

When logged on you will be presented with a screen listing the projects, of which there are currently none

Hit 'Create Project'

For 'Name' enter terminal*x*, where *x* is the same unique number from your UserID (user*X*)

'Display Name' and 'Description' are optional labels

Once the project has been created (you will be given a dashboard) change the mode of the UI from Administrator to Developer by clicking on the top left of the UI where it says 'Administrator' and selecting 'Developer'

On the Topology page it will state 'No workloads found' - Click on 'Container Image'

In 'Image Name' enter 'quay.io/ilawson/devex4'

Click on the search icon to the right of the text box

Leave everything else as default and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Hit 'Create'

Wait for the ring around the application icon to change to dark blue - this indicates the application has been started

In the topology page click on the 'Open URL' icon as shown below

This will open another tab with a command line in it - this is your terminal for the duration of the basic workshop

Switch back to the UI and click on the userx displayed at the top right and select 'Copy Login Command' as shown below

In the new tab that appears login with your userx (unique number instead of x) and password 'openshift'

Click on 'Display Token'

Copy the command given for 'Log in with this token' - this may require using the browser 'copy' command after highlighting the command

Close this tab and switch to the terminal tab - if you have closed the terminal tab go back to the UI and select the 'Show URL' from the topology view in the Developer UI

Paste and execute the command

Press 'y' to use insecure connections

The terminal should now be logged on - to check it try

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc version
----

The terminal should display your user for the first command and the client and Kubernetes versions for the second command

One last command is needed to clone the material needed for the workshop in a writeable way for the attendee. Enter the following commands:

[source]
----
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/utherp0/workshop4
