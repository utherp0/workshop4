=== Introduction

.OpenShift Serverless
****
OpenShift Serverless, based on Knative is the serverless technology that was introduced in OpenShift 4.2. OpenShift Serverless enables Pods running on OpenShift to be scaled to 0 therefore taking zero processing power. Only when called, OpenShift Serverless will scale the Pod up on demand before processing the request. OpenShift Serverless also has the ability to autoscale based on load before eventually scaling back to zero when no requests are being received. 

OpenShift Serverless supports "Serving" and "Eventing"

At the time of writing, Eventing is in Tech Preview

"Serving" enables request/response workloads, and Eventing enables asynchronous event based workloads using cloudevents. In this lab, we are going to look at serving, and how easy it is to integrate with Camel K.

=== Check the project is ready to use

In the browser based terminal window, check you are still logged on and using the correct project by typing:

[source]
----
oc whoami
oc project
----

TIP: If the response from the commands indicates that you are not {{USER_ID}} and not using the project sandbox-{{USER_ID}} please repeat the commands in the pre-requisites.

=== OpenShift Serverless and the Operator Lifecycle Manager

.OpenShift Serverless and the Operator Lifecycle Manager
****
OpenShift Serverless uses the Operator Lifecycle manager, this means that its operator and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) will be added to OpenShift via "OLM". Once created, the new CRDs will extend the OpenShift data model allowing OpenShift Serverless to be managed using the standard ‘oc’ command. Installing operators requires a higher cluster privilege so the presenter will have already set these up for you.

=== Creating the pre-requisites for the chapter

Before we can create an integration, we need to check that the camel-k integration added in a previous chapter is still active

In the terminal window, type

[source]
----
cd /workspace/workshop4/attendee/camelfiles/camelkplatform
oc apply -f integrationplatform.yaml
----

This will either create the integration platform or, if it is still active, indicate it is unchanged

now type

[source]
----
oc get integrationplatform
----

The output should look similar to below

[source]
----
NAME      PHASE
camel-k   Ready
----

Once the "Phase" says "Ready", you can continue

=== Deploy a Restful Integration using Camel K and an OpenAPI definition 

.Introduction to the integrations that we will use
****
This integration is a simple hello world Restful integration. The Restful API interface is defined by the OpenAPI json document called greeting-api.json. This is demonstrating top down API design with Apache Camel. An Apache Camel Route can implement this interface without the need for code. Using a "from" action called "direct" the integration enables the Camel Route to listen/respond to the operation id defined in the OpenAPI document.

Feel free to have a look at both of the files to understand whats going on.

In the terminal window, the files are located in the directory /workspace/examples

OpenAPi definition: greetings-api.json
Camel K integration: greetings.groovy

****

In the terminal window, deploy the integration

[source]
----
cd /workspace/examples
kamel run --name greetings --property camel.rest.port=8080 --open-api greetings-api.json greetings.groovy
----

Go to the developer view in the OpenShift Console

NOTE: If this is the first time you've deployed a Camel K integration, it will take a few minutes to download the dependencies 

Once, the Integration is deployed, the topology view should look like the screnshot below

image::camekknativeserving-1.png[Integrations running]

Camel K has detected that OpenShift Serverless is installed and automatically deployed the integration as a Knative serving (because it's API based) service.

TIP:: The next set of instructions will only be possible if Knative Serving hasn't already scaled the pod back to zero. If you do not see any running pods then please move on to the section title "Knative in action"  

To view the logs for the integration, click any where inside the "dotted lines"

image::camekknativeserving-2.png[Viewing overview of running Integration]

Click on 'View Logs'

You should see a screen similar to the one below

image::camekknativeserving-3.png[Running Pod]

Click on the row name e.g. greetings-xxxxxxxxxxxx

This should show you a screen similar to the one below

image::camekknativeserving-4.png[Pod Details]

Click on 'Logs' to view the log for the pod. It should look something like the one below

image::camekknativeserving-5.png[Pod Details]

=== Knative in action

Following the steps above, you might find that the pod you are looking for is not there. That's because Knative Serving has scaled the pod back to zero.

With the OpenShift console switch to developer view, viewing the toplogy. Your screen might look like the one below. If it doesn't, wait for up to 30 seconds and it scale down to zero. By default, Knative scales down an inactive pod after 30 seconds.  

image::camekknativeserving-6.png[Knative serving]

Next we are going to make a call to the greetings API. To do this, you need to find out the name of http route.
To do this, in the terminal window, type in the following command

[source]
----
oc get service.serving.knative.dev
----

You should see something similar to the picture below

image::camekknativeserving-8.png[Knative serving]

In the terminal window type (make sure you substitute the URL you see from running the command above). Note we are adding the /camel/greetings/YOURNAMEHERE bit to the URL

[source]
----
curl -m 60 URLFROMABOVE/camel/greetings/YOURNAMEHERE
----

After a few seconds you should get a response, and the topology view should now look similar to the picture below. The dark blue circle indicates that the service is now executing.

image::camekknativeserving-7.png[Knative serving started]

Knative has automatically scaled the service to one pod, and processed the curl request.

TIP: Options are available in Knative to determine how to scale based on concurrent calls or cpu useage. Options are also available to determine maximum number or pods, and also the inactivity time before a pod scales its self down - by default, all the way back down to zero.

Deploying Integration Services with Knative can't get easier than that!

To clean up before the next chapter run the following commands in the terminal:

[source]
----
kamel delete greetings
----

=== Knative Revisions

Knative Revisions are for all Knative service deployed on OpenShift, not just Camel K. Knative revisions are a point in time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to a service deployed on OpenShift. Revisions enable progressive rollout and rollback of chanages by rerouting traffic between service names and revision instances. 

This is powerful as it means the Knative route can be configured to balance traffic between different version of the revision ensuring a low risk release of new versions into production e.g. New revision is created, and we'll start by only giving it 10% of the traffic whilst the old version takes the main load. Gradually, the percentage can be moved to 100% before retiring the old version of the service. 

This part of the lab will demonstrate doing this will the OpenShift Developer console, and also the Knative cli

==== Using the console

To demonstrate multiple revisions, you need to make a small change to the Camel K integration.

In the terminal window

[source]
----
vi greetings.groovy
----

You will see the following line:

[source]
----
*.simple('Hello from ${headers.name}')*
----

This is the message returned to the caller with the query parameter "name" appended; change the line to (or something similar) by pressing [ESC] then I

[source]
----
*.simple('Hello from ${headers.name} from the newer revision')*
----

Save it by pressing [ESC] then :wq[RETURN]

Now deploy this version of the integraton API using:

[source]
----
kamel run --name greetings --dependency=camel-rest --dependency camel-undertow --property camel.rest.port=8080 --open-api greetings-api.json greetings.groovy
----

By running the integration again, you will automatically create a new revision of the integration

Test the integration again (don't forget to replace the URL as before)

[source]
----
curl -m 60 URLFROMABOVE/camel/greetings/YOURNAMEHERE
----

You should see the new response message returned

For information, in the console, if you switch to Administrator view you can see the deployed revisions.

In the OpenShift Console select the Administrator View using the top level selector, then Serverless/Revisions

image::camekknativeserving-9.png[Knative serving revisions]

Now select Serverless/Services

TIP: You will see one Knative Service. Rather than just going big bang to the new revision, you want to direct 50% of the traffic to the orginal revision, and 50% of the traffic to the new revision. To achieve this, we need to modify the routing rules in the Knative Service.

Fortunately, in the OpenShift consoles developer view, there is a really easy way to achieve this

Switch back to the developer view, looking at the topology. 

It probably looks similar to the one below (without the arrow). 

image::camekknativeserving-10.png[Topology view]

Click on *KSVC greetings*

This should open a panel on the right hand side that shows both revisions with 100% traffic distribution going to the first revision in the list. As per the screenshot below

image::camekknativeserving-11.png[Revision view]

Click on *Set Traffic Distribution*
Click on *Add Revision*

Select the other revision from the selection box as per the screenshot below

image::camekknativeserving-12.png[Revision Routing split]

Now, change the routing percentage split between the 2 revisions and add a tag to each revision. 

The tag is used by the Knative service to perform the routing.

Your configuration should look similar to the screenshot below

image::camekknativeserving-13.png[Change Routing split]

==== Using the Knative cli

To demonstrate multiple revisions, you need to make a small change to the Camel K integration.

In the terminal window

[source]
----
vi greetings.groovy
----

You will see the following line :-

*.simple('Hello from ${headers.name}')*

This is the message returned to the caller with the query parameter "name" appended

change the line to (or something similar)

*.simple('Hello from ${headers.name} from the newer revision')*

Now deploy the new version of the integraton API

[source]
----
kamel run --name greetings --dependency=camel-rest --dependency camel-undertow --property camel.rest.port=8080 --open-api greetings-api.json greetings.groovy
----

Keep looking at the *revision list* to see when the new revision is ready. Once ready = 'True' split the traffic.

Lets tag the current version as stable, get the name of the revision running by typing the following in the terminal window

[source]
----
kn revision list
----

In the terminal below, replace *greetings-8j7cb* with what you see on your screen

[source,shell]
----
kn service update greetings --tag greetings-8j7cb=stable
----

Test the integration again (don't forget to replace the URL as before)

[source,shell]
----
curl -m 60 http://Substitute with your URL from about/camel/greetings/YourName
----

You should see the new response message returned

For information, in the console, if you switch to Administrator view you can see the deployed revisions.

Administrator View --> Serverless --> Revisions

image::camekknativeserving-9.png[Knative serving revisions]

If you look at 

Administrator View --> Serverless --> Services

You will see one Knative Service. Rather than just going big bang to the new revision, you want to direct 50% of the traffic to the orginal revision, and 50% of the traffic to the new revision. To achieve this, we need to modify the routing rules in the Knative Service.

Now, update the service to route 50% of the traffic to the latest version, and 50% to the stable version

[soure,shell]
----
kn service update greetings --traffic stable=50,@latest=50
----

Check that the service has been updated correctly

[soure,shell]
----
kn service describe greetings
----

You should be able to see the split between each revision.

Also, if you look at the topology view in the console. The routing should be visible there as well.

Test the service by using curl to hit the endpoint again

curl -m 60 http://Substitute with your URL from about/camel/greetings/YourName

Repeat this a few times, you should see the result alternative between the revisions
